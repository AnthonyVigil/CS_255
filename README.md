Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client is a company called DriverPass who was aiming to create an application that assists people in passing their driving tests. They requested to design a system where multiple users are able to interact with the resources depending on their roles.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I gathered the requirements in detail and created use cases for this project very well. I analyzed the interview notes and distributed them into use cases while also including the actors with their respective functions.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would pick the sequence diagram, as it is not very detailed given the amount of space needed for the system design. I would improve it by adding the classes of the other users such as the IT Officer, Owner and DMV; Giving those users the functions they need. Each step would be shown in a flowing manner.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
First, I read the interview transcript and wrote down the requirements that were established. As many of the users will utilize the system, separating the internal users and external users was important. For example, the DMV will be giving an update on changed policies and test questions to the administrator so we can count it as an external requirement. Breaking down everything into small tasks allowed for the project foundation to be set. It is important to consider the user's needs as they will be utilizing the system created from the client's requirements to help succeed in passing the exam. Making the system as convenient as possible would keep the user satisfied.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The approach I take towards designing software is first finding the required factors. This includes establishing the classes, objects, methods, or functions. After it is established, I would create a UML Class Diagram to help give a visualization of the process. In the future I would analyze more of the requirements in detail to make sure I do not miss any functions.
