Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client is a company called DriverPass who was aiming to create an application that assists people in passing their driving tests. They requested to design a system where multiple users are able to interact with the resources depending on their roles.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I gathered the requirements in detail and created use cases for this project very well. I analyzed the interview notes and distributed them into use cases while also including the actors with their respective functions.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would pick the sequence diagram, as it is not very detailed given the amount of space needed for the system design. I would improve it by adding the classes of the other users such as the IT Officer, Owner and DMV; Giving those users the functions they need. Each step would be shown in a flowing manner.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
